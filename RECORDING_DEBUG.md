# Debugging the Recording Issue

## Problem
The recording doesn't start when pressing 'r'. No console errors and no backend requests.

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check the browser console**:
   - Open the browser developer tools (F12)
   - Go to the Console tab
   - Press 'r' and look for the debug messages:
     - "Key pressed: r recording: false sessionId: true"
     - "Starting recording..."
     - "startRecording called, sessionId: [session-id]"
     - "Requesting microphone access..."
     - "Microphone access granted, creating MediaRecorder"
     - "MediaRecorder started"

2. **Check for microphone permissions**:
   - Make sure the browser has permission to access the microphone
   - Check the site permissions in the browser address bar
   - Try a different browser if needed

3. **Check the recording state**:
   - Look for the recording indicator in the UI
   - It should show "Recording... Release 'r' to stop" when recording

## Possible Issues

1. **Microphone permission denied**:
   - Browser will show a permission prompt
   - If denied, recording won't start

2. **Session not initialized**:
   - Check if "sessionId" is available in the console logs
   - If not, the session might not have started properly

3. **MediaRecorder not supported**:
   - Some browsers might not support the MediaRecorder API
   - Check browser compatibility

## Testing

1. **Test with a simple recording**:
   ```javascript
   // Test in browser console
   navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
     .then(stream => {
       console.log('Microphone access granted');
       stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
     })
     .catch(err => console.error('Microphone access denied:', err));
   ```

2. **Check session status**:
   ```javascript
   // Test in browser console
   console.log('Session ID:', window.sessionId);
   ```

## Next Steps

Based on the console output, we can identify the exact issue:
- If no keypress logs: Event handlers not working
- If keypress logs but no recording: Session or permission issue
- If recording starts but doesn't stop: State management issue
- If recording starts and stops but no audio: Audio processing issue
